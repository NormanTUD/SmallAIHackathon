# SmallAIHackathon
A small script for an AI hackathon that tried to optimize hyperparameters

# Requirements
Currently, this script can only run on Taurus when you use the run.sh. 
Install TensorFlow to your local machine or virtualenv (specified in
install.sh) and ignore the missing 'ml' when installing or running.

# How to run
Use `bash run.sh` to run. All arguments will be passed to `python3 network.py`.
Use `--help`
